# Chip-to-chip-wireless-communication
This is the repository that stores the important modules related to the Masters research project" Chip to chip wireless communication".
It contains two modules:
1)Random.py --->It simulates RF wireless network on chip architecture under random traffic based on RL based adaptive CSMA .
2)Butterfly.py-->It simulates RF wireless network on chip architecture under butterfly  traffic based on RL based adaptive CSMA.
